# SD project 2

The this project extends a different distributed systems project by adding security, external service interaction, and fault tolerance. Key tasks include implementing **TLS** for secure communication, integrating with external services like Dropbox using OAuth, enabling Google Sheets integration, and adding caching mechanisms. 

Fault tolerance involves replicating the spreadsheet server with state machine replication, using either indirect communication (e.g., Kafka) or primary/secondary protocols for server failover.
